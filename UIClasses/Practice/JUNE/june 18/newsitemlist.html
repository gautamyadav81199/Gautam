    <h3>News Item 1</h3>

    <h3 class="newsitem1">When it comes to dealing with corruption, even some of the Bhartiya Janta Partyâ€™s supporters would agree that there is a disconnect between what the party had promised before Lok Sabha polls and what it has been doing after winning the same.</h3>

    <p id="specialnews">The nation heard a lot of statements from BJP leaders who hold significant positions in the government. But, the sincerity to deal with corruption is still missing. A SIT was formed to deal with black money holders who have accounts with Swiss banks only after a push from the SC to do so. The committee has not shown any fruitful results or disclosures as of now. </p>
